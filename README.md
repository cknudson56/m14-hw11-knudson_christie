## Resources
I used a number of source on appendChild() to see if I was doing something wrong. But nothing very valuable and still went back to my orginial code.

## Issues
I had an issue with the API and forgetting to link the js to the html. Not a mistake I am pround of, but I will probably never forget that from now on.
